/*-Node.js is just a run time environment
  version of JavaScript - meaning that it 
  runs on your machine rather than a 
  browser like traditional JS, that is why
  VSCode shows NodeJS instead of JS, it 
  is not a language or framework
  - Servside JS frameworks are like Express, 
  Next.js

  -Node.JS is written in C++ and is helps run 
  JS on servers.  
  - Preliqusites: HTTP, JSON, Arrow Functions, 
  Promises, MVC Pattern
  - Benefits; fast, efficient, scallable, 
  popular, front and back end usage, uses
  non-blocking I/O (works on a single thread, 
    supports thousands of concurrent connections, 
    optimized for scalability with many I/O, fast
    and efficient)
  -Best Projects for Node.JS: REST API & microservices, 
  Real Time Services (chat, live updates), CRUD APps,
